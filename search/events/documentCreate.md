The Microsoft Build of OpenJDK binaries are based on OpenJDK source code, following the same build scripts used by the Eclipse Adoptium project and tested against the Eclipse Adoptium Quality Assurance suite (including OpenJDK project tests). Our generally available binaries have passed the Java Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK) which is used to verify compatibility with the Java specifications. The Microsoft Build of OpenJDK is a drop-in replacement for any other OpenJDK distribution available in the Java ecosystem.

The Microsoft Build of OpenJDK is a no-cost distribution of OpenJDK that's open source and available for free for anyone to deploy anywhere. It includes Long-Term Support (LTS) binaries for Java 11 and Java 17 on x64 server and desktop environments on macOS, Linux, and Windows, AArch64/ARM64 on Linux and Windows, binaries for macOS on Apple Silicon (AArch64/M1), and musl libc compiled binaries for Alpine Linux on x64.
